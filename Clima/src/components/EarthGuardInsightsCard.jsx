    question: "How does NASA provide real-time weather information?",
    answer:
      "Global climate data is gathered by NASA satellites and integrated into MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version-2) and other reanalysis models. Values like temperature, wind, humidity, and clouds are then made available using the POWER API. This enables us to convert unprocessed scientific data into user-friendly weather categories.",

  {
    question: "How can NASA data help predict floods?",
    answer:
      "When heavy rainfall meets already-saturated soil, flooding frequently results. SMAP satellites detect soil moisture, while NASA's GPM mission delivers rainfall data in almost real-time. When taken as a whole, they provide scientists with a clear picture of the locations and times of floods.",

    question: "How is NASA data used in disaster response and planning?",
    answer:
      "NASA offers satellite observations in near real-time to help with quick response during disasters like hurricanes or floods. In the long run, the same data helps communities become more resilient by informing planning for climate adaptation, agriculture, and water management.",

  {
    question: "How does NASA monitor cyclones?",
    answer:
      "NASA satellites gather data on wind, precipitation, and storms from space. Geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites are mainly used to monitor cyclones. Together, the CYGNSS mission and GPM improve cyclone monitoring and forecast by measuring surface winds inside storms and rainfall intensity, respectively.",

    question: "How does NASA monitor drought conditions?",
    answer:
      "NASA tracks drought from space using a number of satellites. GRACE-FO finds subsurface water storage, MODIS monitors vegetative health, and SMAP measures soil moisture. When combined, these findings provide a comprehensive picture of both short- and long-term drought.",

    links: ["https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM"]
  },
  {
    question: "How does NASA track clouds and storms?",
    answer:
      "Satellites like MODIS (on Terra and Aqua) and GOES capture cloud images and storm movements every few minutes. This allows scientists to monitor storm growth and intensity in real time.",

    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does soil moisture data help in flood prediction?",
    answer:
      "NASA‚Äôs SMAP mission measures soil moisture globally. If soil is already saturated, even moderate rainfall can lead to flooding, making this data key for flood risk forecasting.",
    links: ["https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/"]
  },
  {
    question: "How is groundwater monitored during droughts?",
    answer:
      "NASA‚Äôs GRACE-FO satellites detect changes in Earth‚Äôs gravity caused by shifting underground water storage. This reveals how much groundwater is being depleted during drought.",
    links: ["https://gracefo.jpl.nasa.gov/"]

  {
    question: "How are NASA APIs used by developers?",
    answer:
      "APIs like NASA POWER provide weather and solar radiation data for apps. Developers can build tools for forecasting, agriculture, and renewable energy planning.",
